# SimpleMachine 

**Simple Machine** is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
NumPy.

The project was started in 2020 during the pandemic to create a beginner friendly machine learning library.

It is currently under development, i am hoping to finish the intial version before Oct 2020.

Installation
------------

**Dependencies**
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleMachine requires:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy (>= 1.13.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
**User installation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the initial version is released if you have a working installation of numpy,
the easiest way to install SimpleMachine is using ``pip``   ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn
    
Else you can clone this github directory and keep it in the same folder as the project you are working on.

Important Info
-------------

Documentation of the files is not complete yet

The accuracy of the algorithms is currently the same as those of in the scikit learn module. We intend to optimize the speed and accuracy of the models further in an more advance version of this library.
